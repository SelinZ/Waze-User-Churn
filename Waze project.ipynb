The median churned user had a similarly disproporionate number of drives per drive day compared to retained users.\n\nIt is clear from these figures that, regardless of whether a user churned or not, the users represented in this data are serious drivers! It would probably be safe to assume that this data does not represent typical drivers at large. Perhaps the data&mdash;and in particular the sample of churned users&mdash;contains a high proportion of long-haul truckers.\n\nIn consideration of how much these users drive, it would be worthwhile to recommend to Waze that they gather more data on these super-drivers. It's possible that the reason for their driving so much is also the reason why the Waze app does not meet their specific set of needs, which may differ from the needs of a more typical driver, such as a commuter.",

Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\n\n> *The dataset has 700 missing values in the `label` column. There was no obvious pattern to the missing values.*\n\n2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\n\n> *Mean is subject to the influence of outliers, while the median represents the middle value of the distribution regardless of any outlying values.*\n\n3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n\n> *Yes. For example, the median user who churned drove 698 kilometers each day they drove last month, which is about 240% the per-drive-day distance of retained users. It would be helpful to know how this data was collected and if it represents a non-random sample of users.*\n\n4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n\n> *Android users comprised approximately 36% of the sample, while iPhone users made up about 64%*\n\n5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\n\n> *Generally, users who churned drove farther and longer in fewer days than retained users. They also used the app about half as many times as retained users over the same period.*\n\n6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\n\n> *No. The churn rate for both iPhone and Android users was within one percentage point of each other. There is nothing suggestive of churn being correlated with device.*",
